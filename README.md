# emoji-create

In this deep learning project for beginners, we have built a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions. We have trained our model on the FER2013 dataset. Then we are mapping those emotions with the corresponding emojis or avatars.

Using OpenCV’s haar cascade xml we are getting the bounding box of the faces in the webcam. Then we feed these boxes to the trained model for classification.
